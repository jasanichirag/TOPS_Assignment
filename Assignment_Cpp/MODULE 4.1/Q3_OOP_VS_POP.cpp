    // Q3 }-->  What is the difference between OOP and POP? ;
    /*

===> OOP [Object-Oriented Programming]:
        {
         => This type of programming language uses objects and classes for creating models.
         => Object-Oriented Programming
         => Bottom-up approach
         => Method overloading and overriding are used in OOP to achieve polymorphism.
         => Inheritance	Supports
         => Code Reusability	Supports
         => Security	Data handling is possible in OOP due to programming.
         => Problem-Solving	Used for solving big problems.
         => Example	C++, JAVA, C#, .NET

     }

===> POP [Procedure Oriented Programming]:
        {
        => This programming language uses a step-by-step approach for breaking down a task into a collection of routines and variables by following a sequence of instructions.
        => Procedure Oriented Programming
        => Top-down approach
        => It doesn’t support polymorphism.
        => Inheritance -->	Do not support
        => Code Reusability	-->	Don’t support
        => Security	-->	It is less secure than OOP.
        => Problem-Solving	-->	Not suitable for big problems.
        => Example	-->	C, FORTRAN
