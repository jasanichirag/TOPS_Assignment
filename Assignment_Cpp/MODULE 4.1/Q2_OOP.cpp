    CONCEPTS OF OOPS :-

        class  : {
                 Class can be defined as a blueprint of the object
                 }
        object  : {
             An Object can be defined as an entity that has a state and behavior, or in other words, anything that exists physically in the world is called an object. It can represent a dog, a person, a table, etc
            }
        encapsulation :{
             The wrapping up of data and functions together in a single unit is known as encapsulation. It can be achieved by making the data members' scope private and the member functionâ€™s scope public to access these data members. Encapsulation makes the data non-accessible to the outside world.
            }
        inheritance :{
             Inheritance is the process in which two classes have an is-a relationship among each other and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class. The class which inherits the features is known as the child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class. For example, Class Vehicle is the parent class, and Class Bus, Car, and Bike are child classes.
            }
        polymorphism : {
             Polymorphism means many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form. It is a feature that provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. It can be implemented using function overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function.
            }
        abstraction : {
             Abstraction helps in the data hiding process. It helps in displaying the essential features without showing the details or the functionality to the user. It avoids unnecessary information or irrelevant details and shows only that specific part which the user wants to see.
            }
